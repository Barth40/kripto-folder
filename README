# Kripto Data Engineering Pipeline

A Databricks + Delta Lake project for streaming cryptocurrency market data from Bronze → Silver → Gold layers, then loading into Azure SQL and visualizing in Power BI.

##  Overview

This project implements a medallion architecture (Bronze, Silver, Gold) to process real-time cryptocurrency market data in Databricks, using PySpark and Delta Lake on Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2.

The pipeline ingests raw JSON API data into the Bronze layer, cleans and standardizes it in the Silver layer, and aggregates it into business-ready tables in the Gold layer.

From the Gold layer, clean and aggregated data is loaded into Azure SQL Database for creation of data warehouse, modelling and easy integration with Power BI for analytics and reporting.

Data Flow Summary
Bronze Layer:
Uses Databricks Autoloader to incrementally ingest raw JSON data from the cryptocurrency API into Delta Lake tables.
Schema is semi-structured JSON, stored as Delta tables.

Silver Layer:
Applies schema validation, data cleaning, and deduplication.
Adds ingested_time column for audit tracking.

Gold Layer:
Performs aggregations such as market cap rankings, price changes, and category-level summaries.
Outputs clean, analytics-ready Delta tables for reporting.
Loads aggregated data into Azure SQL Database for analytics.

Azure SQL & Power BI:
Data from Gold layer is pushed to Azure SQL Database.
Power BI connects to Azure SQL for business analytics and interactive reporting.
